# ChatGPTDiscord
A discord bot using openAI's ChatGPT api to act as a smart chat assistant allowing for natural, conversational interactions between users and the language model. This can be a great way to generate creative ideas, have engaging discussions, or even just pass the time with some entertaining banter.

Currently setup for a single channel, and a single conversational thread.

Accepts discord file upload of text based files (analyse code or essays!)

Splits output from chatgpt into multiple messages to get around discord message size limits.

Removes common limitation phrases from output, and rebrands OpenAI to EvilCorp.
